## Project Log

* 03.05.2024
    - 935: Creating a new project to get started. Working between RStudio and VsCode to understand what is best. I do know that underneath it is an implementation of BLAS as gFortran is a package listed when getting this from the CRAN repository.
    - 943: As a way to begin in a clean manner, having at least four years since working with this software, go [here](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).
    - 1000: Version on both Win11 and Deb12, for comparative-learning purposes. After all, it's all math; linear algebra actually. Guess I can exercise the time spent in the Graduate level 5600 class all those years ago!
